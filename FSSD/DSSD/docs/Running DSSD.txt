		*** DSSD -- Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery ***

 :-: Setting up :-:

Now that you've downloaded these binaries of the DSSD implementation,
getting up to speed should be easy. That is, provided that your system
meets some basic criteria.

First of all, you need a Windows machine. Second, you will to have the
Visual Studio 2010 SP1 redistributable package installed. I provide
both 32-bits (x86) and 64-bits (x64) binaries, the appropriate
redistributable packages can be downloaded from

x86: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328
x64: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13523

Unpack all files in the DSSD zip file to a directory on your hard drive,
ensuring to maintain the directory structure that is present within the
zip file.


 :-: Configuring DSSD :-:
 
In dssd/bin, you will find the binaries and configuration files (which
all have the extension .conf).

* Use emc.user.conf to set the maximum amount of memory that the program
is allowed to use. Note that this is mainly used by Krimp when generating
candidates -- if DSSD needs memory, it needs memory. Some of DSSD's 
directives allow for influencing memory usage though.

* dssd.exe is 32-bits, dssd64.exe is the 64-bit version. DSSD can be run 
in two ways:
	1) Specify the config filename in emc.conf and simply launch `dssd'
	2) Type `dssd <configname>', eg `dssd dssd-creditg'
 
 
 :-: Data, data, data :-:

Each dataset should be in 
	dssd/data/<dsName>/<dsName>.arff
Unsurprisingly, it should be in ... ARFF format, originating from Weka.
Additionally, a second file should be present, ie
	dssd/data/<dsName>/<dsName>.emm
which defines which attributes should be used as description attributes
and which as model attributes. One of the two can directives can be set
to *, meaning that the remainder of attributes is assigned to that part
of the space.
With this package, I provide two example datasets: CreditG for single-target
classical subgroup discovery and Emotions for multi-target exceptional
model mining. See these two working examples for further hints.

 
 :-: Performing Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery :-:
 
dssd-creditg.conf and dssd-emotions.conf provide example configurations 
for running DSSD on CreditG and Emotions respectively. The files provide
some additional hints on usage, and the two papers that describe DSSD
could also help out:

1] van Leeuwen, M. & Knobbe, A.J. Non-Redundant Subgroup Discovery in Large 
and Complex Data. In: Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine 
Learning and Principles and Practices of Knowledge Discovery in Data 2011
(ECML PKDD'11), 2011.
2] van Leeuwen, M. & Knobbe, A.J. Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery. 
In: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 2012. (To appear)

After DSSD finished, all results are available in 
	dssd/xps/dssd/<dsName>-<timestamp>/
Such directories can contain up to 3 pairs of results/stats-files:
	results1-<timestamp>.sg / stats1-<timestamp.csv
contains subgroup descriptions and statistics after DSSD phase 1,
and similarly for results2/stats2 and results3/stats3.
(When one of the three phases is disabled, its corresponding files are
also missing.)

  
 :-: Evaluating individual subgroups :-:

The binaries can also be used to evaluate subgroup individually, one by
one or many at a time. For this purpose, evaluatesg.conf is provided.
This could be useful, for example, when you have obtained subgroups 
using one quality measure and would like to compute their qualities
using a different quality measure.


 :-: That's all folks :-:

That's all, at least for now. Should you run into problems or have any 
other questions with regard to DSSD, you may contact me at

Would you like to have functionality that is not in this release, such
as other quality measures, consider downloading the open source package
containing all source code. More information about this on
